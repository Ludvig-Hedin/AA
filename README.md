"1. dont use tabs for the sign up / sign in. Have a button that says something like "already have an account? Sign in"

2. Remake the styles. Style guide designed to support both light and dark modes while delivering a clean, minimalist aesthetic inspired by Notion and ChatGPT. It uses a primarily monochrome color palette accented with subtle hues for visual interest.

Style Guide
1. Design Aesthetic
Overall Look & Feel:

Clean, minimalist design with a focus on simplicity and clarity.
Consistent and unified styling across the entire app.
Ample white (or negative) space to ensure a clutter-free interface.
Design inspiration drawn from Notion's simplicity and ChatGPT's modern interface.
Design Principles:

Prioritize readability and usability.
Emphasize clarity through simple, flat design elements.
Follow design best practices from Apple (e.g., minimalism, intuitive interactions) and Google (e.g., material design principles).
2. Color Palette
Primary Palette:

Use a monochrome base for both light and dark modes.
Integrate subtle accent colors sparingly to highlight interactive elements.
Dark Mode Settings:

Primary Background: #121314
Primary Text: #FFFEFC
Borders: #434343
Secondary Text: #9A9A9A
Light Mode Settings:

Primary Background: #FFFEFC
Primary Text: #040404
Secondary Button Border: #E6E3DE
Secondary Text: #ADABA9
Accent Color (Optional - Blue):

Accent: #2383E2
(Apply to interactive elements such as links, buttons, or hover states)
3. Typography & Spacing
Font Choices & Hierarchy:

Primary Font: Use a clean, sans-serif font (e.g., Helvetica, Arial, or a similar web-safe font).
Font Hierarchy:
Headings: Bold and clear (e.g., h1, h2, h3 with decreasing sizes).
Body Text: Regular weight for readability.
Captions/Labels: Slightly smaller with a lighter weight.
Sizing:
All sizing (fonts, margins, paddings, etc.) should be specified in rem units for scalability and consistency.
Spacing Guidelines:

Use consistent margins and paddings across components.
Ensure sufficient spacing between elements to maintain clarity and avoid visual clutter.
4. UI Components
Buttons:

Primary Buttons:
Background should use the accent color (#2383E2 when applicable).
Text should contrast with the background (e.g., white on blue).
Rounded corners or subtle shadows may be applied for a modern look.
Secondary Buttons:
Border color for light mode: #E6E3DE
Utilize transparent or monochrome backgrounds with appropriate hover states.
Inputs & Forms:

Text Inputs, Dropdowns, and Checkboxes:
Use clear, defined borders (using the dark mode border #434343 or equivalent in light mode).
Maintain a consistent style for focus and hover states.
Ensure input fields have enough padding for usability.
Backgrounds & Cards:

Cards and panels should adopt the primary background colors for each mode.
Use subtle borders or shadows to define sections without overwhelming the design.
5. Technical Guidelines
CSS Class Naming:

Follow the Client First convention to maintain clarity in your styles. For example, class names should be descriptive and reflect their purpose (e.g., client-header, client-button-primary).
Platform Guidelines:

Apple & Google:
Incorporate design principles from both ecosystems to ensure a familiar, intuitive experience for users on all platforms.
Prioritize performance and responsiveness.
Responsive Design:

Use media queries to adjust layout and component sizes for various screen sizes.
Ensure that the design works well across devices, from mobile to desktop.

Final Notes
Consistency is Key:
Ensure that every component adheres to this style guide. Consistency across typography, spacing, and color usage is vital to maintain a cohesive and professional look.
Iterative Refinement:
As you develop the app, continuously test and refine the styles, especially when switching between light and dark modes.
Accessibility:
Double-check color contrast ratios and ensure that the design meets accessibility guidelines for all users.
Does this style guide cover all your requirements, or is there any area you'd like to further expand or clarify?

Please store these styles somewhere so you know in the future.

I already have some pages created like thge sign up and sign in pages, they are tsx files. Use that if thats the best.

please keep all styles in the styles.css file. No more css fiels are needed
